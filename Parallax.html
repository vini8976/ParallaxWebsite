        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Hey,Thank you being a part of this website. As the name suggests Eye-openener, lets's have a brief discussion 
            about it. What is Mental Health? what is Anxiety Attacks? what is Depression? what is Panic Attacks? I know these
            question will never end but the simpler these words pretend or look are not that simple in real life and the person
            suffering from it.But being a part of a judgemental society what we actually do is just judge these people without 
            knowing or recoganising their actual issue and the condition of that person. But being a part of this society we have to keep a 
            eye on this problem and help the people to come out of this problem without being judgemental. There should be steps 
            taken regarding this problem beacause it is leading to suicides, mental disorder and many more health issues.

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>There are many reason behind this problem. Some are not happy by their own existence, some are going through financial, family or many other issues, some 
            are suffering from loss or traumas etc. In reality we can't just guess or identify what the person is going through because in reality happy faces bear a lot
            of pain. As we can see this problem is increasing in young generation because they are not guided what they have to really do . They keep on doing what satisfy their soul,
            either that thing is good or bad for them. They don't know what is right or wrong , they just see what is going around them and start following them. Be it 
            intoxication, indulging in wrong activities or circle, stressing over carrier or family problems. Every individual is suffering from atmost one problem. 
            It's the high time that one should look on this serious problem and try to solve it.

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>We all know that in present time no one is going to talk about this problem beacause no one really cares. We have therapist, hospitals, various medicines so, why will anyone will think to finish these types of problem.
            Why do we really need all this when we can live a healthy life ? Why can't being a part of this society we can bring up some change? We all know someone from our family must be suffering through all this
            but we are unable to recoganise due to lack of knowledge about all this. It's high time to spread knowledge about this by various acts and help the people who really need us.
            Teenagers need to be educated about what is wrong or right , so that they don't take any wrong step and live happily. Now, everyone will think why should we do this but we also have brother, sister, daughter, son, father, mother.
            If they would be going through all this, then also for a second this question will not come our mind's. Instead of being selfish, it's time to become a helping hand for everyone and 
            try to look beind this problem . A single change, can lead to a great success.
